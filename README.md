# Code-Quiz
 
-Description

    This is a simple code quiz application designed to test your coding knowledge. The quiz consists of a series of questions, and you will be timed as you answer them. Be careful, though – incorrect answers will deduct time from the clock. Once you have answered all the questions or the timer reaches 0, the game will be over. You'll then have the opportunity to save your initials along with your score.

-Getting Started

    To start the quiz, simply click the "Start" button. This will initiate the timer and present you with the first question.

-Answering Questions
    Once a question is presented, choose the correct answer. Clicking on the correct answer will proceed to the next question. Be cautious – answering incorrectly will result in time being subtracted from the clock.
